Unless the vulnerability is so new that there is no definition, a missing update shouldn\u2019t be the issue.

An intrusion detection system (IDS) or intrusion protection system (IPS) can detect and stop attacks, and may even capture some tools, but they are not designed to capture local commands and downloaded tools.

Risk mitigation is when a\rcompany implements controls to reduce vulnerabilities\ror weaknesses in a system. It can also reduce the\rimpact of a threat. Risk avoidance is the removal of the\rvulnerability that can increase a particular risk so that\rit is avoided altogether. Risk transfer is the act of\rmoving the risk to other organizations like insurance\rproviders or hosting companies who assume the\rresponsibility for recovery and restoration or by\racquiring insurance to cover the costs emerging from a\rrisk.",
