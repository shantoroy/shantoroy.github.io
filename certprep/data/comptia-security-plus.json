        "explanation": "Correct Answer: Forward proxy servers fetch content on behalf of internal client devices, and they can require authentication and enforce time of day restrictions.\nIncorrect Answers: Reverse proxy servers map public IP addresses and port numbers to internal servers. Port Address Translation (PAT) allows many internal clients to get to the Internet using a single public IP address. Network Address Translation (NAT) is similar to a reverse proxy server except it cannot force user authentication or time of day restrictions; it applies to OSI model 4 (transport layer), not layer 7 (the application layer).",
