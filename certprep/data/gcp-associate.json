        "explanation": "Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) is specifically designed for deploying, managing, and scaling containerized applications using Google's infrastructure. While App Engine can run containers, it's primarily a PaaS for applications. Compute Engine is an IaaS solution that requires more management, and Cloud Functions is a serverless compute service for event-driven code.",
