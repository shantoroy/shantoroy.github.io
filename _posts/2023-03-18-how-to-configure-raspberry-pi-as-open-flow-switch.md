Buying an open flow switch can cost you a few hundred dollars. However, we can build a low-cost open flow switch from the scratch.

To build a low-cost open flow switch, we will need a Raspberry Pi and a few (max four) USB-to-Ethernet (alternatively, known as USB-to-LAN) converter cables.

There are many tutorials that discuss how to configure a Raspberry Pi as an Open Flow Switch. However, following the same steps can make you face many issues, which I have faced earlier while working on a project.

In this blog post I will note down the entire process that works with the latest version changes and compatibility issues. I will also show how I tried to troubeshoot the issues and eventually reached to solutions.

## Download Openvswitch
Let's first download openvswitch
```bash
$ wget http://openvswitch.org/releases/openvswitch-2.5.2.tar.gz
```
and unzip
```bash
$ tar -xvzf openvswitch-2.5.2.tar.gz
```

## Install Dependencies
Now, let's install dependencies
```bash
$ apt-get install python-simplejson python-qt4 libssl-dev python-twisted-conch automake autoconf gcc uml-utilities libtool build-essential pkg-config
$ apt-get install linux-headers-3.10-3-rpi
```

## Fix Linux Headers
If the right compatible linux header is not there, we may run into issues when configuring the `openvswitch`.

```bash
$ cd openvswitch-2.5.2
$ ./configure --with-linux=/lib/modules/3.10-3-rpi/build
```
### Updated Linux Header Version Issues
If we have issues, let's first check the installed versions
```bash
$ ls /lib/modules/
5.15.76+  5.15.76-v7+  5.15.76-v7l+  5.15.76-v8+
```
These are recent versions available after we installed linux headers.
Now, let's check with one of these:
```bash
$ ./configure --with-linux=/lib/modules/5.15.76+/build

configure: error: Linux kernel in /lib/modules/5.15.76+/build is version 5.15.76, but version newer than 4.3.x is not supported (please refer to the FAQ for advice)
```
Now, we get errors again.

### Check for available linux headers
We can check for the available linux headers using the following command:
```bash
$ apt search linux-headers
```
And we see, there is nothing less than `5+` version.

Now, let's look at the following link to find updated versions. And voila! It also states supporting linux kernel associated with each version.

https://docs.openvswitch.org/en/latest/faq/releases/

### Another Try
The following is what I tried later. 
```bash
$ wget http://openvswitch.org/releases/openvswitch-3.0.0.tar.gz
$ tar -xvzf openvswitch-3.0.0.tar.gz
```
and then
```bash
$ cd openvswitch-3.0.0/
$ ./configure --with-linux=/lib/modules/5.15.76+/build
$ make
$ make install
```

Well, it didn't work for me either. Somehow, there was a missing `datapath` directory inside.

## Finally Worked for Following Versions
Here, I am sharing for the versions that worked for me fine. Let's first get the openvswitch.
```bash
$ wget https://www.openvswitch.org/releases/openvswitch-2.17.1.tar.gz
$ tar -xvzf openvswitch-2.17.1.tar.gz
```

Let's install the following version of linux headers
```bash
$ apt-get install linux-headers-4.9.0-6-rpi
```
and then do the rest.
```bash
$ cd openvswitch-2.17.1
$ ./configure --with-linux=/lib/modules/4.9.0-6-rpi/build
$ make
$ make install
```

Now, to make `modprobe` work, we need to restart the raspberry pi. When rebooted, let's do the following:
```bash
$ su
$ cd openvswitch-2.17.1/datapath/linux/
$ modprobe openvswitch
```

Then we need to create a file named `ovs_script.sh` with the following code:
```
#!/bin/bash
ovsdb-server --remote=punix:/usr/local/var/run/openvswitch/db.sock \
    --remote=db:Open_vSwitch,Open_vSwitch,manager_options \
    --private-key=db:Open_vSwitch,SSL,private_key \
    --certificate=db:Open_vSwitch,SSL,certificate \
    --bootstrap-ca-cert=db:Open_vSwitch,SSL,ca_cert \
    --pidfile --detach
ovs-vsctl --no-wait init
ovs-vswitchd --pidfile --detach
ovs-vsctl show
```

Then we need to create a file named `ovs-vswitchd.conf` in the configuration directory to track the details of the switch.
```bash
$ touch /usr/local/etc/ovs-vswitchd.conf
```
and a directory
```bash
$ mkdir -p /usr/local/etc/openvswitch
```
Then we need to populate the database. Here I used relative paths.
```bash
$ cd ../..
$ ovsdb-tool create /usr/local/etc/openvswitch/conf.db vswitchd/vswitch.ovsschema
```


Need to go back to the previous directory (datapath/linux), where we created the script. Then we need to run the script.
```bash
$ cd -
$ chmod +x ovs_script.sh
$ ./ovs_script.sh
```


```bash
$ /usr/local/share/openvswitch/scripts/ovs-ctl --system-id start
$ ./ovs_script.sh
```
And we just configured a Raspberry Pi to act as an Open Flow Switch.

## Concluding Remarks
The existing tutorials I found online does not have the fix for the Linux Header compatibility. While following those steps I faced the issues and eventually could solve it.

I hope, now, you can configure a Raspberry Pi to act as an Open Flow Switch without any issue. In a later tutorial, I will show how to work around the switch.

Until then, have a great time!
