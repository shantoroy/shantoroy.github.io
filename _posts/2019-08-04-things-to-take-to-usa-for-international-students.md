I got admitted as a Ph.D. student at the University of Houston, leaving for the USA this August. Here, I list the items to take to the USA as an international student.

I am from the sub-continent (Bangladesh), and the items listed here are mostly based on our lifestyle and habits here.

**Edit:** Many items are already available in Houston at a low price. I assume it is because there are many shops in Texas, of which the owners are from the sub-continent. Therefore, it is better to consult the international students already living where you are going. That is how you know which items to take and which not.
