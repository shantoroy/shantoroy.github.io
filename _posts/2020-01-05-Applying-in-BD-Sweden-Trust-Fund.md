Many students come to the USA, Europe, and Australia from Bangladesh each year for higher study purposes. However, many students do not know that we can apply for a one-way travel grant (BD to Outside) to the Bangladesh-Sweden Trust Fund (BSTF).

To be noted, it is applicable for students who have not received a travel grant from any other source (e.g., Erasmus Mundus covers the travel grant).

Here is how to apply for a travel grant to BSTF.
