In today's world, access to information has never been easier thanks to powerful search engines and advanced language models such as OpenAI's ChatGPT. However, simply being skilled at Googling or expert in using the right search keywords is no longer enough to find the information you need efficiently. That's why the importance of `conversational skills` in the age of language models in immense.

## The days of browsing page after page is gone

Previously, a person had to browse through page after page of search results only to find that the information they were seeking wasn't there. And it happened due to use of good enough the search keywords, search engine optimizations, and advertisements. 

With language models, people can now ask questions in natural language, just as they would ask another person, and receive accurate and relevant answers in seconds. And if not in the first conversation, maybe within $2/3$ more conversations. 

This has made search engines far more accessible and user-friendly and has opened up a whole new world of information to people who might have otherwise been exhausted by traditional search methods and not finding the desired answers.

## Why the power of good conversational skills matter!

But this shift in search efficiency isn't just about making things easier. It's about unlocking the full potential of these language models. 

The ability to ask questions in natural language and engage in conversation with language models is a valuable skill that is becoming increasingly important in today's world. With good conversational skills, people can quickly and easily get to the main point and find the information they need without wasting time clicking on random links and browsing through irrelevant or incorrect results.

Moreover, good conversational skills can also help to create a more personalized search experience. Language models can understand the context and intention behind a person's questions. Therefore, the models can provide results that are more suited to specific needs and interests.

## Concluding Remarks
Previously, people would often say that being good at Googling or using the right keyword mattered. However, with the access to language models that are trained based on huge amount of texts; now it is the conversation skill that matters most.

For myself, previously I had to look into tons of resources to just find one particular thing, specially when I was doing some research works. Now, it is a matter of seconds I come to know what I was exactly looking for. And I started making myself better at conversational skill rather than working more on search keywords.
