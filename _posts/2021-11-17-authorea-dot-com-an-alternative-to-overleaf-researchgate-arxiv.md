[Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com) has been the mostly used cloud-based Latex editor that features collaboration and provides numerous templates across different criteria. Today I found a new alternative and in this post I will share my thought on this new platform.

The new platform [Authorea](https://www.authorea.com/) also provides a latex editor that is more user-friendly. In my opinion, it merged some benifits of using [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com), [Researchgate](https://www.researchgate.net/), and [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/). However, it seemed to be a new platform that still is in its early ages and lot more to offer in the future. 

I immediately signed up out of curiosity and took a look at the features. So far, after using $5-10$ minutes, I found the following features:

1. It has Latex, Markdown, and general text editor
2. It offers integration of interactive document and graphs (plotly)
3. It has collaboration option like [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com)
4. Supports direct submission to a few journals
5. You can upload/share a preprint like you can in [Researchgate](https://www.researchgate.net/) and [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/)
6. Your dashboard is available for others to visit your public documents

The features at a glance

A sample latex editor looks like as follows

And here is the dashboard, the public document section is available to view for everyone.

You can try taking a look at my [public profile](https://www.authorea.com/users/446514-shanto-roy). There is nothing though. :wink:

Now, let me add some cons of using this platform:

1. As I mentioned earlier, it is in its early stage and a lot more to offer. The UI/UX requires to be improved. 
2. It is free to use, however, one can have only $10$ documents maximum. This is the reason I disliked it most. Overleaf free version offers unlimited documents to keep in your account.
3. It has the potential to be a good social network, however, still, ResearchGate offers a lot more options that makes ResearchGate the best social platform. Also, ResearchGate is free to use.
4. While uploading preprints, researchers still prefer ArXiv. I don't think it will be viable to upload preprints here when you can upload unlimited preprints to ArXiv.
5. It has only a few templates where Overleaf literally have thousands of very good templates for everything

Anyway, this platform seems to provide a lot of options in the future and still has a long way to go. I may have missed some good features too as I have not spent enough time on it. It does not look a good alternative to Overleaf, ResearchGate, or ArXiv so far. Maybe in the future, we can expect a healthy competition when this platform becomes more mature.

These are just my point of view. Whether you agree or disagree, feel free to write your thoughts in the comment section. Thanks. Have a good day.
