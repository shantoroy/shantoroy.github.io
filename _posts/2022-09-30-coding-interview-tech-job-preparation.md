Coding interview is one of the most common steps in an tech job interview. Here, I have added a few resources to prepare ourselves in a short time.


## Short List of Codes
[Blind 75](https://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/460599/blind-75-leetcode-questions) is a curated list of top $75$ questions that cover all data structures and problem variations. The study plan is also available in [The Tech Interview Handbook](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/best-practice-questions/). However, [Grind 75](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75?fbclid=IwAR256MthD_ltXzy4AzfFx7ZmsehRXJVowtvqxg_MuhbLczmkV_GbbhvlLFw) provides the best outline in an interactive manner, where you can customize the duration of practice. Also, if you need YouTube videos for understanding the problems, you can find [Blind 75 Leetcode problems : Detailed Video Solutions](https://takeuforward.org/interviews/blind-75-leetcode-problems-detailed-video-solutions/) pretty useful.
