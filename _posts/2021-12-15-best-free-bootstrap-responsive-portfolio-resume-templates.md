Personal website or portfolio works as our own marketing tool for letting people know about our skills, products, and personalities. I started my personal website using the [Google Sites](https://sites.google.com/new). If interested, you can check my [first portfolio website](https://www.shantoroy.me).

Then I started my own blog using a `Jekyll` theme called [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/). Initially, I created a portfolio here with the same theme. However, that does not look very cool and I started looking for some responsive portfolio templates that I can use. If you go to the [resume](https://shantoroy.com/resume/) section of my blog, you will find me using one. The template I have been using is `Resume-bootstrap4`.

However, i found a few other templates really awesome. You can download these templates for free. All you need to know is basic HTML. Then just start editing, host somewhere, and attach a domain name.

Here is a list of top five my most favorite and suitable bootstrap templates (specially for students):

* Resume-bootstrap4 $\rightarrow$

* Profile-Bootstrap $\rightarrow$

* iPortfolio $\rightarrow$

* Creative-CV $\rightarrow$

That's all for today. If you found any other good-looking free templates, please let us know in the comment section. Thanks!
