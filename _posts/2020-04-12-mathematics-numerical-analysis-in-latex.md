excerpt:  "If you're writing mathematical documents, Latex is a great tool for creating professional-looking equations and symbols. However, it can be overwhelming to use if you're not familiar with its syntax and math environments. In this post, I'll guide you through the basics of math environments, symbols, and how to use them properly to create clear and concise mathematical documents in Latex. I also provided some resource links to follow."

Writing mathematics in Latex seems to be a bit difficult at first. However, here I compiled a short summary on how you can write good mathematical expressions easily with examples.

I am assuming, you already know some basics how to write basic equations. Here, I show you how you can present and document it in well manner.

If you are new to Latex, this post might be helpful for you. Check [Latex Resources in a Nutshell](https://shantoroy.com/latex/latex-resources-in-a-nutshell/).

## Environments
### Within Paragraph/Texts
1. Use **`$$`** for mathematical expressions inside text. For example, `$x^2 + y^2 = z^2$` will look like $x^2 + y^2 = z^2$. 

2. You can also use `parenthesis` for equations inside text. For example, `\(x^2  + y^2  = z^2\)` will look like $x^2 + y^2 = z^2$ in the output document.


### Outside Paragraph/Texts
1. Use `\begin{equation}...\end{equation}` to write equations. Put your mathematical symbols within this environment and it will add an equation number as well.
```
% With equation number
\begin{equation}
	x^2 + y^2 = z^2 
\end{equation}
```
To avoid equation number, use `\begin{equation*}...\end{equation*}`
```
% Without equation number
\begin{equation}
	x^2 + y^2 = z^2 
\end{equation}
```
2. Aligning equations is one of my favorite option and it can be done using `\begin{align*}...\end{align*}`. We actually use it to align several equations.
```
\usepackage{amsmath}
\begin{align*}
	x^2 + y^2 &= z^2 \\
	x^3 + y^3 &= z^3
\end{align*}
```
Here, `&` helps to keep the equations aligned. Use `\\` for newline.
Or, you can use `\begin{multline*}...\end{multline*}`.
```
\begin{multline*}
f(x) = (a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 + e^2 + f^2)\\ 
-(g^2 + h^2 + i^2 + j^2)
\end{multline*}
```

3. You can also simply use `\[...\]` and put mathematical expressions within this.
```
\[
	x^2 + y^2 = z^2
\]
```
