When running **legacy applications** in **production**, a standard Dockerfile won't be enough.  

We need to ensure extra features such as:  
✅ **Security** – Running non-root, minimizing attack surfaces  
✅ **Performance** – Optimized layer caching, removing unnecessary files  
✅ **Compatibility** – Handling older dependencies without breaking the system  
✅ **Reliability** – Ensuring services don’t crash, logging properly  
✅ **Multi-Stage Builds** – Reducing final image size  

In this guide, we’ll build a **production-grade Dockerfile** optimized for legacy apps.

## Key Considerations for Production

### 1. **Minimize Image Size**  
Use **multi-stage builds** to install dependencies in a temporary container and copy only necessary artifacts. It also ensures optimality and additional security.

### 2. **Security Best Practices**  
- Avoid running as `root`  
- Limit unnecessary package installations  
- Remove sensitive files right after the setup  

### 3. **Dependency Handling**  
Some **legacy apps require older dependencies**. Using a compatible base image and carefully installing necessary packages is key.

### 4. **Process Management**  
Legacy apps might use multiple processes. Using **supervisord** or process managers ensures proper startup. If you want to know more about supervisor applications/processes, check my [other blog post](https://shantoroy.com/sre/supervisor-program-running-in-linux/).

## The Advanced Production-Ready Dockerfile

###  **Multi-Stage Build for an example Legacy Python Application**

```dockerfile
# Stage 1: Build dependencies
FROM python:3.10-slim AS builder

WORKDIR /app

# Install necessary build tools
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    build-essential \
    libpq-dev \
    gcc \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Copy only the requirements file to leverage Docker layer caching
COPY requirements.txt .

# Install dependencies in a virtual environment
RUN python -m venv /opt/venv && \
    /opt/venv/bin/pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Stage 2: Final production image
FROM python:3.10-slim

WORKDIR /app

# Install runtime dependencies (minimal install)
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    libpq5 \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Copy pre-built dependencies from builder stage
COPY --from=builder /opt/venv /opt/venv

# Set environment variables for the virtual environment
ENV PATH="/opt/venv/bin:$PATH"

# Copy application source code
COPY src /app/src

# Ensure non-root user execution
RUN useradd -m appuser && \
    chown -R appuser:appuser /app/src
USER appuser

# Expose the application port
EXPOSE 8080

# Use a process manager (supervisord) to run multiple services
COPY supervisord.conf /etc/supervisor/conf.d/supervisord.conf

CMD ["supervisord", "-c", "/etc/supervisor/conf.d/supervisord.conf"]
```
