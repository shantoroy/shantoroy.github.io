Nowadays, graduate students are focusing on preparing better CV/Resume templates in Latex rather than preparing one in other word processing tools. 

So, what's the difference between a **CV** and a **Resume**? A CV has no page limit and people in academia prefer it to use. On the other hand, the industry prefers one or maximum two page resumes. Maybe this why many graduate students prefer to use resumes who are applying for an internship, part-time or full-time jobs.

Here, in this post, I provide the list of `Latex CV/Resume template` collection and a few best-looking example templates to start with.
