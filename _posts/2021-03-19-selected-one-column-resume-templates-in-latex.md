Recently, I was looking for a few one-page resume templates in Latex. Obviously, the best resource collection to start looking for is the [Overleaf Template Gallery](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/tagged/cv). 

I liked a few ones and here are my top five choices:

* [Resume template by Anubhav](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/resume-template-by-anubhav/dhmkrwtksdgy)

* [Data Science Tech Resume Template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/data-science-tech-resume-template/zcdmpfxrzjhv)

* [Modern-Deedy](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/modern-deedy/cxtjgrmpsrvh)

* [Software Engineer Resume](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/software-engineer-resume/gqxmqsvsbdjf)

* [Juan D Cardozos Resume](https://www.overleaf.com/articles/juan-d-cardozos-resume/ybgpjdqmvhkc)

My last resume was created using the `deedy-resume` class, which had a two-column style. You can find the modified version in this [overleaf project](https://www.overleaf.com/read/zyhnvchgkscq). 

However, I found two-column resumes difficult to render when chosen the option to obtain information from uploaded resume in the online resume submission portals. Therefore, I have decided to use one-column resumes to apply for internship in the next summer.
