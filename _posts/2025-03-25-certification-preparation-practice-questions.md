## About the Cert Preparation Question Bank

The **Certification Preparation Question Bank** is an open-source project designed to help learners practice for various certification exams. Currently, it is in **beta mode**, and I'll try to actively expand the question sets.

Unlike traditional exam simulations, this platform focuses on **practice mode**, allowing users to go through questions at their own pace, review answers, and learn effectively.

## Currently Available Certification Exams

We are continuously adding new certifications, but as of now, the following exams are included in the question bank:

- **AWS AI Practitioner**
- (More to come – stay tuned!)

If you are preparing for these certifications, you can start practicing right away!

## How to Contribute

This project is open-source, and contributions from the community are highly encouraged! You can help by adding new questions, improving existing ones, or expanding the explanations.

### Steps to Contribute:
1. Visit the GitHub repository: **[TBA]**  
2. Follow the contribution guidelines in the `README.md` file.
3. Add new questions to the relevant JSON files.
4. Create a new question bank by creating a JSON file for a Cert.
5. Submit a Pull Request (PR) for review.

Your contributions will help build a valuable learning resource for many aspiring professionals.

## Supporting the Project

If you find this project useful, consider supporting it in the following ways:
- **Contribute Questions** – Help expand the question bank!
- **Spread the Word** – Share it with others who are preparing for certifications.
- **Donate** – Your donations will help sustain and grow the project.
