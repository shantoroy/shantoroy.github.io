In the [previous post](https://shantoroy.com/network/write-a-reverse-proxy-server-in-python/), we have coded the `reverse proxy server` in python. In this post, I will cover the server code for the servers in a pool waiting to process user data.

### Required Modules
As usual, we need the similar modules that we required to build a reverse proxy server. I only add a new module here: `hashlib`. This module is used for hashing a particular data. In our setup, we will use `sha1` hashing algorithm to hash user payload and return the digest back to the user via reverse proxy.

```python
# Import required modules
import socket
import _thread
import threading
import hashlib
import json
import sys
```

## Functionalities
Each server in the pool has the following functionalities
- Connect to the Reverse Proxy by sending a particular type (type: 1) of packet 
- Receive user data (type: 2) via reverse proxy and returns processed data back to the reverse proxy server

### Packet used to Connect to a Reverse Proxy
```json
{
 "type": 1 // 1 is a connection setup message from a server
 "id": 999, // id of the server
 "privPolyId": 999, // privacy policy of the server
 "listenport": 999 // port on which the server is listening
}
```

### User data packets
```json
{
 "type": 2, // 2 is an ACK from a server to a client
 "srcid": 999, // source (server) id
 "destid": 999, // destination (client) id
 "payloadsize": 999, // payload size
 "payload": "xyz" // payload
}
```


## Coding in Python
### Option Set up
The following function checks for available options and receives each input arguments that will help us to run the servers. Here, we have to input four arguments
- id $\rightarrow$ server ID
- pp $\rightarrow$ privacy policy (indicates a particular type of service)
- listen $\rightarrow$ listening port
- revproc $\rightarrow$ reverse proxy port

It will give user the usage message if the user does not run the script based on our need.

```python
def option_check():
    global args

    # all available argument options
    avail_options = ["-id", "-pp", "-listen", "-revproc"]

    # receive user given options
    options = [opt for opt in sys.argv[1:] if opt.startswith("-")]

    # receive user given arguments
    args = [arg for arg in sys.argv[1:] if not arg.startswith("-")]

    # raise error if user given option is wrong
    for i in options:
        if i not in avail_options:
            raise SystemExit(f"Usage: {sys.argv[0]} (-id & -pp & -listen & -revproc) <argument>...")

    # raise error if not all options or arguments are available
    if len(options) != 4 or len(args) != 4:
        raise SystemExit(f"Usage: {sys.argv[0]} (-id & -pp & -listen & -revproc) <argument>...")
```

### Receiving Packets from the Reverse Proxy Server
In our setup, any message coming from the reverse proxy has to be a user packet data. After receiving the data, the server extracts the payload and generates a hash. Then creates a new type-2 packet with changed source and destination address, payload length, and new payload (hash digest). Now, it returns the packet back to the reverse proxy.
```python
# after receiving each connection from reverse proxy/client
def on_new_client(clientsocket,addr):
    while True:

        msg = clientsocket.recv(2048)
        if not msg:
            # lock released on exit
            print_lock.release()
            break

        json_msg = json.loads(msg.decode())
        print("Received a message from client", json_msg["srcid"], "payload", json_msg["payload"])
        payload = json_msg["payload"]
        new_msg = hashlib.sha1()
        new_msg.update(payload.encode())
        hashed_payload = new_msg.hexdigest()
        new_json_msg = {"type":"2", "srcid": str(args[0]), "destid": json_msg["srcid"],\
                        "payloadsize": len(hashed_payload), "payload": hashed_payload}
        
        print("Sending a message to the client", new_json_msg["destid"], "payload", new_json_msg["payload"])
        clientsocket.send(json.dumps(new_json_msg).encode())
    clientsocket.close()
```

### Connect to the Reverse Proxy
We need a function that connects to a reverse proxy when the server script is initiated. This function binds the reverse proxy name/IP with the reverse proxy port (last argument `revproc`) and establishes a communication with the proxy server. The function also sends additional data so that the reverse proxy can record the server privacy policy, listening port, and ID.
```python
# Connect to the Reverse Proxy
def connect_reverse_proxy():
    new_json_msg = {"type":"1", "id": str(args[0]), "privPolyId": str(args[1]),\
                        "listenport": str(args[2])}
    # rev_proxy_name = 'reverseproxy.ddns.net'
    rev_proxy_name = '127.0.0.1'
    rev_proxy_port = int(args[3])

    rev_proxy_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    rev_proxy_socket.connect((rev_proxy_name, rev_proxy_port))

    rev_proxy_socket.send(json.dumps(new_json_msg).encode())
    rev_proxy_socket.close()

```

### Main Function
Now, letâ€™s create our main program where we follow the mandatory socket communication steps (binding host and port, listening for clients, etc.). Here, we start thread for each new socket communication.
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    option_check()
    s = socket.socket()         # Create a socket object
    host = '127.0.0.1' # Get local machine name
    port = int(args[2])              # Reserve a port for your service.


    print ("Server running with id", args[0])
    print ("Server serving privacy policy", args[1])
    print ("Listening on port", args[2])
    
    # Broadcast "Alive" status to the Reverse Proxy first
    connect_reverse_proxy()
    print ("Connecting to the reverse proxy on port", args[3])

    # Binds to the port
    s.bind((host, port))     
    # Allow 10 clients to connect
    s.listen(10)                 

    # Receive/Process each client connection in a seperate thread
    while True:
        c, addr = s.accept()     # Establish connection with client.
        # lock acquired by client
        print_lock.acquire()
        print ('Received a message from client', addr, "payload")
        _thread.start_new_thread(on_new_client,(c,addr))
        
    s.close()
```
