Sometimes, we need a cheatsheet for a particular technology or a language to attend an exam or an interview. 

A python cheatsheet is always handy in a situation when we need to remember certain methods, for example string methods; or a particular data structure. I find a cheatsheet most useful during a coding interview.

In the following, I list a few collection of Python Cheatsheets:

4. [https://geekflare.com/python-cheat-sheets/](https://geekflare.com/python-cheat-sheets/)

5. [https://cheatography.com/tag/python/](https://cheatography.com/tag/python/)

I find [Cheatography](https://cheatography.com/) as the primary resource of cheatsheets for any language or topic out there. It includes cheatsheets of programming languages, databases, tools, DevOps, Markup, Frameworks, and different useful topics.

That's all for today! Have a great day!!!
Cheers!!! :sunglasses:
