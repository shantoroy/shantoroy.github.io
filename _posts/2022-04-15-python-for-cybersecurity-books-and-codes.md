This post provides the necessary Github links for a few cyber security books. Initially, I wanted to list the resources related to "Python for Cyber Security" and then ended up listing a few other book and resource collections.

The first part is primarily listing the renowned "Awesome Collections" available in github. The second collection has download links of some popular cyber security books. And the final collection includes the code resources (Python for Cyber Security).
