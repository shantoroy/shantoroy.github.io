Recently, we have visited Austin. Austin is quite beautiful with landscapes and there are many hiking and biking places around. It was a cool journey and here I provide a very short description of our day-long tour from Houston. 

## Timing
We started from Houston, at around 8:30 am. Reached Austin 360 at around 11:15 am and spent time until around 01:00 pm. Then we went for Lunch in the city and came back to Bull Creek at around 02:00 pm. Later we went to Zilker Park and Lady Bird Lake, spent the quality time until 05:30 pm. Then we visited Mount Bonnel followed by the Oasis on Lake Travis, to watch the sunset. 

## Tour Plan
- Austin 360 
- Bull Creek 
- Zilker Park/Lady Bird Lake 
- Mount Bonnel 
- Oasis on Lake Travis 

## Carrying my Hardtail MTB
Austin is really cool for hiking and biking. There are so many hiking and biking trails nearby wherever you go. That's why I took my hardtail MTB (Specialized Rockhopper Sport 27.5 Cobalt Blue) attached to the bike rack mounted on the car.
