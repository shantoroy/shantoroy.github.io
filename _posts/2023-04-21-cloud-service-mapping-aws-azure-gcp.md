Hi there!!! ðŸ‘‹

If you are a cloud computing researcher or practitioner, you definitely worked with one of the most popular public cloud providers: Amazon Web Service (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Provider (GCP).

These services offer a lot of products for particular service needs and it's even difficult to remember all the names or map the alternatives.

Recently, I found a GitHub repository that provides a comprehensive list of products across AWS, Azure, and GCP side-by-side based on target services. 

In this post, I talk about that repository, add a simple basic map for common services myself, and added some free course links found on twitter.

## Cloud Service Mapping

Created by Milan MilanoviÄ‡, [this repository](https://github.com/milanm/Cloud-Product-Mapping) provides an easy-to-read infographic that maps out the different cloud services offered by the three major cloud providers, organized by purpose. The infographic covers services related to computing, storage, networking, databases, security, analytics, machine learning, and more.

This resource is handy for those looking to compare and contrast the services offered by each cloud provider for a specific purpose or use case. For example, suppose you're looking for the best solution for data warehousing. In that case, the infographic can quickly point you to AWS's Redshift, Azure's SQL Data Warehouse, and GCP's BigQuery.

This Cloud Product Mapping repository is a valuable resource for anyone navigating cloud services. It's especially helpful for those who need to compare and contrast the offerings of AWS, Azure, and GCP for specific use cases.


## Example Map of some Popular Services
I'm also adding an example mapping of some popular services here:

Thought, it would be worth sharing!

That's all for today, guys! Cheers!!!
