## Latex Editors
### Online
There are several latex editors available online. However, none of the other ones are as powerful and trusted as `Overleaf`. Overleaf comes with a lot of templates including the official conference/ journal templates. You will also find `CV` templates and other letter/report/book templates. I always prefer using online tool over offline ones because you can work collaboratively by sharing the edit link of a document. Also, you do not need to worry about a particular computer and making it heavy with a new software. Previously there was another good platform named `ShareLatex`. Now, it is merged with Overleaf.
* [Overleaf](https://overleaf.com/) (Obviously Preferred)
* [Papeeria](https://papeeria.com/)

### Offline 
Although I do not prefer using latex offline, I had a good experience using the following two latex editors. The extra advantage you will find here is the shortcut formatting options alike `MS Office` or `Libre Office` so that you will not have to memorize many of the commands. Though, everything can be found online within milliseconds.
* [TeXmaker](https://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/)
* [TexStudio](https://www.texstudio.org/)

Note that, you will have to install latex environment first before installing these editors:
* [MacTeX](https://tug.org/mactex/) (Mac OS)
* [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) (Linux)
* [MikTeX](https://miktex.org/) (Windows)
