Hi there!!! 👋

It's the fifth day of the `#100dayschallenge`, and today I will talk about the importance of Automation in SRE. I will also talk about the techniques and tools used for Automation. Additionally, I will discuss what skills are required to master automation. 


> "Automation is the cornerstone of SRE. It's what allows us to continuously improve our services, and deliver the best possible experience to our users." - The Site Reliability Engineering Handbook.

So, I have planned the  [contents for next 100 days](https://medium.com/@shantoroy/learning-about-site-reliability-engineering-with-the-100daysofsre-challenge-66380323c0d1), and I will be posting one blog post each and everyday under the hashtag  `#100daysofSRE`. ✌️

I hope you tag along and share valuable feedback as I grow my knowledge and share my findings. 🙌

Alright! Let’s begin…

## SRE in Summary?
In my earlier posts, I have covered SRE basics. Just to remind you, I am summarizing SRE again here.

SRE is a software engineering approach that emphasizes the importance of reliability and scalability in large-scale software systems. 

The primary goal of SRE is to ensure that software systems are reliable, available, and scalable. SRE teams work closely with software development teams to ensure that the software is designed with reliability in mind. 

They are responsible for monitoring, troubleshooting, and optimizing the software systems to ensure they meet the Service Level Objectives (SLOs) set by the organization.


## The Importance of Automation in SRE
>  "Automation is essential to SRE. It frees up time for engineers to work on high-level problem solving and innovation." - Site Reliability Engineering Workbook.

Automation plays a vital role in SRE, and there are several reasons why. Firstly, automation helps SRE teams achieve better reliability. When manual processes are replaced with automated ones, there is less chance of human error. 

For example, automated deployment pipelines can ensure that new code changes are tested thoroughly before being released to production. This can reduce the risk of bugs and errors that can cause system downtime.

Secondly, automation helps SRE teams achieve better scalability. As software systems grow in complexity, it becomes increasingly challenging to manage them manually. 

Automation helps SRE teams scale their operations by automating repetitive tasks, such as deploying new instances, scaling resources, and managing configurations.

Finally, automation helps SRE teams achieve better efficiency. When manual processes are automated, SRE teams can focus on more strategic tasks, such as improving the overall reliability and scalability of the software systems. This can lead to faster incident response times, better monitoring and alerting, and more efficient use of resources.

## Automation Techniques in SRE

There are several techniques that SRE teams can use to automate their processes. Here are some of the most common techniques:

1.  **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** IaC is a technique that involves managing infrastructure using code. This means that SRE teams can use code to automate the deployment, configuration, and management of infrastructure resources. This technique is widely used in cloud environments, where infrastructure resources are highly dynamic.
    
2.  **Configuration Management:** Configuration management involves automating the process of managing system configurations. This includes managing software versions, patches, and updates. Configuration management tools such as Puppet, Chef, and Ansible are widely used in SRE.
    
3.  **Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):** CI/CD involves automating the process of building, testing, and deploying software changes. This technique can help SRE teams ensure that new code changes are tested thoroughly before being released to production.
    
4.  **Monitoring and Alerting:** Monitoring and alerting tools can be used to automate the process of detecting and responding to incidents. These tools can alert SRE teams when there is an issue with the software system, and can even take automated actions to resolve the issue.
    
5.  **ChatOps:** ChatOps is a technique that involves automating communication and collaboration between teams using chat tools. ChatOps can help SRE teams streamline their communication and collaboration processes, and can even be used to automate incident response.

From the perspective of automation, SRE has similar tasks that belong to DevOps and SysAdmin, except these automation techniques and scripts are more focused on reliability.


## Automation Tools in SRE

There are various automation tools that SREs use to automate their tasks and improve the reliability of their systems. Here are some of the commonly used automation tools:

1.  **Ansible** - An open-source automation tool used for configuration management, application deployment, and task automation.
2.  **Puppet** - Puppet is another popular open-source tool for configuration management, application deployment, and task automation.
3.  **Chef** - Chef is an open-source automation tool that provides configuration management and automation of infrastructure tasks.
4.  **Jenkins** - An open-source automation server that automates software build, testing, and deployment.
5.  **Terraform** - An open-source tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently.
6.  **Kubernetes** - Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform for automating containerized application deployment, scaling, and management.
7.  **Nagios** - An open-source monitoring tool for servers, networks, and applications.
8.  **Grafana** - An open-source analytics and visualization platform for monitoring and analyzing data.
9.  **ELK Stack** - An open-source log management and analysis tool that combines Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana.
10.  **Prometheus** - An open-source monitoring tool for collecting and querying metrics from applications and systems.

Many of these abovementioned tools are used for the same purpose. The choice of tools depends on the specific needs of the organization and the system or platform being managed.

We can categorize these tools as follows:

### Configuration Management Tools
Configuration management tools manage and automate configuration changes across servers and other infrastructure components. Examples of configuration management tools include Puppet, Chef, and Ansible.

### Monitoring and Alerting Tools
Monitoring and alerting tools are essential for SREs to identify and resolve issues before they become critical. Examples of monitoring tools include Prometheus, Nagios, and Zabbix. These tools allow SREs to set up automated alerts for events such as service failures, network latency, and system resource utilization.

### Provisioning Tools
Provisioning tools are used to automate the provision of new infrastructure resources, such as servers, virtual machines, and containers. Examples of provisioning tools include Terraform, CloudFormation, and OpenStack.

### Deployment Automation Tools
Deployment automation tools are used to automate the deployment process of new applications and services. These tools help SREs to reduce the risk of human error and ensure consistent deployment across different environments. Examples of deployment automation tools include Jenkins, Travis CI, and CircleCI.

The key to automation fo SREs to scale their operations. As infrastructure becomes more complex and the number of services increases, it becomes more difficult to manage everything manually. Automation tools help SREs to manage larger environments, while ensuring consistent and reliable operations.


## Top 10 Skills Required to Master Automation for SRE

To master automation for SRE, here are some skills that are required:

1.  **Programming:** Knowledge of programming languages such as Python, Ruby, Perl, and Bash is essential to develop scripts, automating processes, and building tools. I checked for different automation codes, which are performed using the `Go` language.
2.  **Linux and Unix:** SREs should deeply understand Unix and Linux systems to perform automation and deployment tasks. Red Hat Linux based certifications can be a good way to progress in this direction.
3.  **Configuration Management:** Knowledge of configuration management tools like Ansible, Puppet, or Chef is essential to automate the configuration of servers and other systems. Configuration management eases the overall system configurations. 
4.  **Cloud Computing:** With the increasing adoption of cloud technologies, SREs should be familiar with cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, and GCP to automate infrastructure provisioning, deployment, and management.
5.  **Monitoring and Metrics:** SREs should have a strong understanding of monitoring tools and metrics, including logging, tracing, and monitoring frameworks like Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK stack.
6.  **DevOps:** SREs should understand the DevOps culture and principles, emphasizing collaboration and communication between development and operations teams.
7.  **Agile:** SREs should understand agile methodologies and processes well to work in fast-paced environments and ensure continuous delivery and deployment.
8.  **Troubleshooting:** The ability to diagnose and resolve problems is essential for SREs. They should be able to identify and fix issues quickly, which requires knowledge of debugging tools and techniques.
9.  **Communication:** Good communication skills are critical for SREs as they work with cross-functional teams, including developers, operations, and business stakeholders.
10.  **Continuous Learning:** Finally, SREs should have a constant learning mindset, essential to keep up with new technologies, tools, and best practices.


## Concluding Remarks
