Managing multiple containers manually with `docker run` can become cumbersome when handling **microservices** or **multi-container applications**. This is where **Docker Compose** simplifies everything by letting you define and run your entire environment using a single YAML file.

âœ… Define infrastructure as code  
âœ… Manage multiple services in one place  
âœ… Automate networking and dependency management  
âœ… Great for **local development** and **testing microservices**  

In this guide, we'll explore **how Docker Compose works** and set up a **full-stack application** with a **frontend**, **backend**, and a **database**.

## âš¡ Why Docker Compose?

### ðŸ”¹ 1. **Simplifies Multi-Container Management**
Instead of running multiple `docker run` commands, Compose lets you **define everything in one file** and bring up the entire stack with:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
