We recently visited the most popular mountain biking trail in Houston. People call it the Anthills hike and bike trail. one thing that I did not know before visiting is, it has a bike park being developed and if you are a true mountain biker you will really like this trail.

Anthills trail is located near the Terry-Hershey Park in Houston. The trail continues along the Bayou and there are all sorts of trails from beginner to expert. You can park your car in the [Anthills Parking lot (Google Map)](https://goo.gl/maps/vt68E27HccESuue37).

Also, there is a [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/anthillsmtb/) of riders visiting the Anthills trail.

I am no expert and ride a hardtail (Specialized Rockhopper Sport 27.5 Cobalt Blue). However, I like to explore different trails and try to make videos of the surroundings.

In these three videos, I tried to cover from the parking area to the Bike park. I used my GoPro Hero 8 Black to capture all the videos. I usually prefer the chest mount for the cycling videos.
