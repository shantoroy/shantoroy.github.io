## About the Blog
At the very beginning, I want to thank you for going through my blog posts. The blog is nothing but some documentation of what I meet, think, and learn in my everyday life. I started this blog intending to write down about the pros & cons of **Education** and **Research** based on what I learned in my ` Ph.D. life`. You will find many helpful posts and tutorials about `Documentation with Latex` and `Data Science in Python` as well. Apart from that, I will keep posting about my other thoughts to help you learn new things or maintain the work-life balance. I like to travel and explore new places. So, there are a few travel diaries as well. :sunglasses:

Why writing? Without documentation, we forget how we do or improve what we did before. That's the primary concern for me. Please feel free to let me know with your feedback if there is an area of improvement in my posts. :v:

In case any of my posts help you solve your problem, and you want to thank me for that, you can <br/>

## About Myself
I love learning, researching, exploring new things, and creating new hobbies. I have been working as a Research Assistant and have enrolled as a Ph.D. student at the Department of Computer Science, University of Houston (since Fall-2019). My primary research interest is in Cyber Security, Data Science & ML, SDN, Cloud-IoT ecosystem, etc.

Currently, I am researching `Cyber Deception` based on our findings of  `Cyber Reconnaissance`. We have developed an IoT Remote attestation testbed where we can simulate different attacks and attestation strategies in another work. Besides, we developed a `Security Game`-based model and solution. We are now working on modeling more complex models and develop solutions using `Reinforcement Learning`. Previously, I worked on data collection, filtering, analyzing, and visualization of smart contract-related posts from Medium.com after joining the RNS Lab at `University of Houston`.

Before joining UH, I worked as a lecturer in the Dept. of CSE, Green University of Bangladesh. I like to collaborate with other researchers, and together we have been working on projects and publications. I also love to have hands-on experiences in System Administration that made me take part in RHCSA, RHCE, Openstack, and CCNA vendor courses and exams. I intend to gather more knowledge that covers the topics of DevSecOps. 

I love to `travel` a lot. I love sports too; the most favorite one is obviously `Cycling`. Apart from that, I play `Cricket` and `Football`(Soccer). `Photography` and music attract me as well. In my spare time, I like to read Quora discussions and watch movies. Life is short, so much to explore, isn't it..? :sunglasses:
