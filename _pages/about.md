## About the Blog
Welcome to my tech blog! This space is dedicated to sharing insights, experiences, and practical knowledge on Site Reliability Engineering (SRE), DevOps, Cloud Computing, System Administration, AI/ML, and Infrastructure Automation.

Originally, this blog covered a wide range of topics, including Cybersecurity, IoT, LaTeX, Python, and research methodologies. While those remain a part of my journey, my recent focus has shifted towards modern software infrastructure, automation, and reliability engineeringâ€”the backbone of todayâ€™s scalable and resilient systems.

Here, you'll find in-depth tutorials, best practices, troubleshooting guides, and hands-on experiments covering:
âœ” CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, ArgoCD, Terraform)
âœ” Kubernetes, Docker, and Infrastructure as Code
âœ” Observability with Prometheus & Grafana
âœ” Cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure)
âœ” AI/ML applications in Ops & Automation

Whether you are an experienced engineer, a DevOps enthusiast, or someone exploring cloud-native technologies, this blog aims to provide valuable insights and real-world applications to enhance your expertise.

I believe in continuous learning and knowledge sharing, and I encourage discussions, feedback, and collaboration. Feel free to engage, share your thoughts, or reach out for meaningful conversations.

ðŸš€ Letâ€™s build, automate, and scale together!
